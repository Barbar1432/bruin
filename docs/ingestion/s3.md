# S3
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a bucket for storing data in Amazon's Simple Storage Service, a cloud-based storage solution provided by AWS. S3 buckets allow users to store and retrieve data at any time from anywhere on the web.

ingestr supports S3 as a source for [ingestr assets](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/assets/ingestr.html), allowing you to ingest data from S3 into your data warehouse.

In order to set up the S3 connection, you need to add a configuration item in the .bruin.yml file and in the asset file. For this, you will need the bucket_name, path_to_file, access_key_id, and secret_access_key. For more information on obtaining the credentials [here](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/filesystem/basic#get-credentials).

Follow the steps below to correctly set up S3 as a data source and run ingestion.

**Step 1: Add a Connection to .bruin.yml**

To connect to S3, you need to add a configuration item to the connections section of the .bruin.yml file. This configuration must comply with the following schema:

```yaml
    connections:
      s3:
        - name: "my-s3"
          bucket_name: "my_bucket"
          path_to_file: "users.csv"
          access_key_id: "AKI_123"
          secret_access_key: "L6L_123"
```

**Step 2: Create an Asset File for Data Ingestion**

To ingest data from S3, you need to create an asset configuration file. This file defines the data flow from the source to the destination. Create a YAML file (e.g., s3_ingestion.yml) and add the following content:

```yaml
name: public.s3
type: ingestr
connection: postgres

parameters:
  source_connection: my-s3
  source_table: 'students_details'

  destination: postgres
```

- name: The name of the asset.

- type: Specifies the type of the asset. Set this to ingestr to use the ingestr data pipeline.

- connection: This is the destination connection, which defines where the data should be stored. For example: "postgres" indicates that the ingested data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

**parameters:**
- source_connection: The name of the S3 connection defined in .bruin.yml.

- source_table: The name of the file or folder in S3 that you want to ingest. For example, 'students_details' would ingest data related to student details. 

**Step 3: [Run](https://bruin-data.github.io/bruin/commands/run.html) Asset to Ingest Data**
```
bruin run --file s3_ingestion.yml
```
It will ingest S3 data to postgres.
